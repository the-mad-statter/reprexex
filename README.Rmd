## Overview

The goal of ``r params$package`` is to provide additional functionality for the [{reprex}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=reprex) package.

<br />

## Installation

You can install ``r params$package`` from [GitHub](https://github.com/`r params$github`/`r params$package`) with:

```r
pak::pkg_install("`r params$github`/`r params$package`")
```

If necessary `pak` can be installed with:

```r
install.packages("pak", repos = sprintf("https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/stable/%s/%s/%s", .Platform$pkgType, R.Version()$os, R.Version()$arch))
```

<br />

## Example

Write reprex code that includes `library(reprexex)` and an `as_img()` around a troublesome object.

```r
library(reprexex)
library(table1)

as_img(table1(~ mpg + cyl, data = mtcars))
```

Copy the code to the clipboard and then run `reprexex()`

```r
reprexex::reprexex()
```

Your code is run and the rendered results written to the clipboard. You are now ready to share your reprex somewhere like StackOverflow with a simple paste.

<br />
